<h1>RPG</h1>
<p>First game I made using vanilla js, and here is the list of programs I used to create it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/431730/Aseprite/?l=portuguese">Gimp</a> for background</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">Aseprite</a> for characters</li>
</ul>

**Set difficulty**

```js

localStorage.setItem('localMonsterLife', 35) // change the monster's life here

```
<p>You may be wondering </p>

> "why you chose to use localstorage to store life?"

<p>The answer is simple: it's because this was the only way I could update the characters' lives in the middle of battle</p>

**AND YES I know that localstorage saves files in the browser cache, to do this you just need to delete it, look for `winnd11.github.io` in your browser settings and delete the data.**

**NOTE: I recommend playing with full screen.**
